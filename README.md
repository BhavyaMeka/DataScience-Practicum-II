# Implementing Deep neural network models for Human Activity Detection

# Project Details
The purpose of this project is to use deep neural networks for human activity detection. Six human activities were detected and logged manually using smartphone’s accelerometer and gyro meter. Usually with domain knowledge the main important features are sorted out for machine learning algorithms and classifying time series data. This DNN model extracts features and learns from raw data with more accuracy.

# Data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set is available in UCI Machine Learning Repository which has details of the 30 subjects between age of 19-48 performing daily human actions. These movements were captured with smartphone’s accelerometer and gyro meter. This dataset contains activity label, time-frequency domain variables, triaxial acceleration, triaxial angular velocity and identifier of the subject. This separated into 70% of trained data and 30% of test data.

# Project Execution
This is a multivariate, time series dataset without any missing values. I intend to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on dataset to get any interesting initial finds from data. Since it’s a deep neural network task I will use Convolution neural network (CNN) by adding several convolution layers, pooling layers and activations and LSTM model.
